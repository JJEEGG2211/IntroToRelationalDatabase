You will also need to have SQL server running to be able to have a relational database

After having the Python and SQL server installed then you run the python scripts
But ensure that you have permission to run those scripts
If you are on unix run the following command 


```
ls -l tournament.py
```

Then check for the attributes in this case they are -rw-r--r--
```
-rw-r--r--  1 username  privilege  4885 Oct 24 13:00 tournament.py
```

then change the permissions by running chmod command, example
```
chmod 755 tournament.py
```

Then you run the scripts, example
```
./tournament.py
```

### Running the program

Then you can finally test the program by running the test script
