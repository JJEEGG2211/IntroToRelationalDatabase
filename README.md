# IntroToRelationalDatabase

This the source code for my implementation of the "tournament" project in Udacity's Intro to Relational Databases course.
It's free! You can try it out at https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197

Its an implementation of a swiss-system tournament (more about this at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament).
It uses Psycopg(2) a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python (http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/) along with bleach (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach).

The code in the files consists of all the files used in the course. It is mainly written in Python along with sql.
